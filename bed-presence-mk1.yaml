substitutions:
  # Calibrate Trigger Percentile
  # This controls how the trigger threshold is set during calibration. During calibration, the unoccupied and occupied
  # pressure values are determined. This is the percentage of the difference between those values required to trigger
  # the "occupied" state.
  #     - 0.75  Requires 75% of the occupied pressure to trigger (Default)
  #     - 0.50   Set trigger exactly in the middle of unoccupied and occupied pressures
  #     - 0.25  More sensitive, likely to be triggered by partner
  # trigger_percentile: '0.75'

  # Fast Sensor Delay
  # This controls how long the "Fast" sensor must register its value before updating. Without any delay, the sensor
  # will register frequent fall negatives as you shift in bed.
  #     - 2s    Same response as standard sensor
  #     - 500ms Good starting point for getting speed without too many false negatives (Default)
  #     - 0ms   No delay, expect frequent false negatives
  # fast_delayed_off: '500ms'
  #
  # Reporting Delta
  # The pressure % must change by this amount before it is reported (note the sensor updates every 60s regardless
  # of this delta).
  #     - 10.0  Only report very large changes
  #     - 1.0   Relatively sensitive with much less reporting (default)
  #     - 0.1   Very sensitive, will report frequently
  # reporting_delta: 1.0
