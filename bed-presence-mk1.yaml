  # Calibrate Trigger Percentile
  # This controls how the trigger threshold is set during calibration. During calibration, the unoccupied and occupied
  # pressure values are determined. This is the percentage of the difference between those values required to trigger
  # the "occupied" state.
  #     - 0.75   Requires 75% of the occupied pressure to trigger (Default)
  #     - 0.50   Set trigger exactly in the middle of unoccupied and occupied pressures
  #     - 0.25   More sensitive, likely to be triggered by partner
  trigger_percentile: '0.75'

  # Fast Sensor Delay
  # This controls how long the "Fast" sensor must register its value before updating. Without any delay, the sensor
  # will register frequent fall negatives as you shift in bed.
  #     - 2s    Same response as standard sensor
  #     - 500ms Good starting point for getting speed without too many false negatives (Default)
  #     - 0ms   No delay, expect frequent false negatives
  fast_delayed_off: '500ms'
