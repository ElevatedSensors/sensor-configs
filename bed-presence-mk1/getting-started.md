## Automatic Sensor Calibration

1. The calibration process requires you to get into and out of your bed. It uses the maximum and minimum observed pressures to automatically figure out the best trigger pressure.
2. Have the person you are calibrating for lay on their side of the bed.
3. Navigate to the device and find the "Configuration" section.
4. Turn on "Calibration \[Right or Left\] (Auto)".
5. Have the person get out of bed.
6. Turn off "Calibration \[Right or Left\] (Auto)".
7. Alternatively, you can manually set the "Trigger Pressure". The Max/Min Pressure values in the "Diagnostic" section can help guide your desired pressure.
